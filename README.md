### calculate order price before create order

Request a quote to receive your exact delivery fee for an order by using the origin address and destination addresses.

This endpoint retrieves calculation information in the format of for a pair of {latitude, longitude} coordinates.

```php
$priceData = [
        "pickup" =>[
            "lat" =>"25.275047",
            "long" => "51.535141"
        ],
        "dropoffs" => [
            [
                "lat" =>"25.277007", 
                "long" => "51.530034"
            ],
                 [
                "lat" =>"25.277005", 
                "long" => "51.530039"
                 ],

        ]
    ];
```

use object

```php
use PassQa\Delivery\Orders;

$order = new Orders('Your token');

$response = $order->Price($priceData);
```

or use facade

```php
use PassQa\Delivery\Facades\PassOrder;

$response = PassOrder::Price($priceData);
```

### create an order

Once you calculated the price of your order, you can use this endpoint in order to create a new order.

```php
$orderData = [
        "addresses"=> [
            "pickup" =>[
